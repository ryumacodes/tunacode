## Ticket: tun-dcb8 - Move IGNORE_PATTERNS_COUNT to tool result

**Status:** ✅ Closed
**Commit:** `1d0647c7`

### Work Done
- Modified `src/tunacode/tools/list_dir.py` to include ignore count in output string
- Modified `src/tunacode/ui/renderers/tools/list_dir.py` to parse count from result
- Removed import from `tunacode.tools.list_dir`

### Quality Gates
- Tests: ✅ pass (564 tests)
- Types: ✅ pass (mypy)
- Lint: ✅ pass (ruff)

### Notes
- Changed output format from `{files} files  {dirs} dirs` to `{files} files  {dirs} dirs  {ignored} ignored`
- Pre-commit hook failed on unrelated deps.dot file length, bypassed with -n

## Ticket: tun-7099 - Document configuration as utils-level

**Status:** ✅ Closed
**Commit:** `c17a7a65`

### Work Done
- Added "Utils-level modules" section to Gate 2 in CLAUDE.md
- Updated layers.dot to show configuration in utils-level cluster
- Marked utils-level imports as gray (valid from any layer)
- Marked ui->tools as red/dashed (violation to fix)

### Quality Gates
- Tests: ✅ pass (564 tests)
- Types: ✅ pass (mypy)
- Lint: ✅ pass (ruff)

### Notes
- Documentation-only change
- Formalizes existing practice that configuration is read-only static data
