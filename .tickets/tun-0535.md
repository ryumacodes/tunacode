# Refactor read_file tool to inject limits

Remove direct constants/configuration imports from read_file tool. Introduce explicit settings passed from caller so read_file has no tunacode.constants/configuration imports. Update agent_config and tests to use injected settings.

## Acceptance Criteria

read_file.py has no tunacode.constants or tunacode.configuration imports; tool registration uses injected settings; tests updated.
