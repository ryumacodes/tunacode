# Update tool factories and UI hooks to use minimal contracts

Wire up the new type aliases and protocols across boundaries.

Scope:
- Tool factory functions accept minimal protocols instead of full state
- UI hooks use explicit callback types
- Remove Any from all boundary signatures

Acceptance:
- All callback surfaces typed - no Any at boundaries
- pyright/mypy passes on boundary modules
- Import graph shows tools don't reach into ui/
