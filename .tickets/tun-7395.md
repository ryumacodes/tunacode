# Expose ToolHandler via StateManager

Remove direct ToolHandler imports from UI by exposing it through StateManager. UI should not instantiate tools directly per Gate 2 dependency rules.

## Acceptance Criteria

No 'from tunacode.tools' imports in ui/main.py or ui/repl_support.py. Tool authorization still works.
