# Remove unused limits helpers

Remove get_read_limit/get_max_line_length (and related defaults if unused) from configuration.limits now that read_file uses local defaults.

## Acceptance Criteria

configuration/limits.py no longer exposes read_file limits; no callers remain.


## Notes

**2026-01-28T19:22:46Z**

Context: read_file no longer consumes configuration limits; get_read_limit/get_max_line_length are unused and should be removed to keep limits.py aligned with actual consumers.

**2026-01-28T19:23:24Z**

Note: This is a temporary solution. We understand the drift risk but are prioritizing larger issues; as a side OSS project we don't have time for smaller fixes right now.
