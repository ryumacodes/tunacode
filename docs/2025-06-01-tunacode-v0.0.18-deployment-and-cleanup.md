## Work Completed

### 1. **Professional Message Updates** (Start of session)
- Fixed unprofessional yolo mode messages in `/home/tuna/tunacode/src/tunacode/cli/commands.py:119-121`
- Changed "Ooh shit, its YOLO time!" → "All tools are now active ⚡ Please proceed with caution."
- Changed "Pfft, boring..." → "Tool confirmations re-enabled for safety."

### 2. **Test Suite Fixes**
- Identified skipped async tests due to missing `pytest-asyncio` dependency
- Installed `pytest-asyncio` and added `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators

### 3. **Documentation Updates**
- Updated `README.md` with v0.0.15 release notes

### 4. **Version 0.0.18 Deployment**

- Committed changes with proper commit messages
- Resolved merge conflict in `src/tunacode/ui/console.py` (kept feature branch changes)
- Successfully deployed to PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/tunacode-cli/0.0.18/

### 5. **Git Branch Cleanup** (End of session)
- Listed all local branches with commit dates
- Identified branches older than 24 hours:
  - `test` branch (5 days old) - safely deleted
  - `tinyagent-pure-sync-migration` (4 days old, 26 unmerged commits) - force deleted
- Kept active branches:
  - `master` (current branch)

3. **Professional UI Messages**: Cleaned up all unprofessional text
4. **Improved Test Coverage**: All async tests now properly configured

## Technical Details

- Resolved import issues in `console.py` after merge conflict
- Updated both `pyproject.toml` and `constants.py` version numbers
- Git commit messages followed project conventions (no Claude/Anthropic credits)

## Next Steps
