# UI Layer

**Package:** `src/tunacode/ui/`

## What

The Textual-based terminal user interface for TunaCode. Handles all user interaction, screen navigation, command routing, and rendering of agent responses, tool outputs, and errors. The UI layer consumes the core agent loop and provides a clean, NeXTSTEP-inspired visual experience.

## Key Files

### Application Entry Point

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.py` | CLI entry point using typer. Handles `--setup`, `--model`, and `--baseurl`, lazily constructs `StateManager` after CLI parsing, and launches the TUI. |
| `app.py` | `TextualReplApp` — the main Textual application. Manages request queue, streaming callbacks, tool result display, ESC handler, clipboard copy shortcuts, and composes all widgets. |
| `streaming.py` | `StreamingHandler` — owns streaming state and throttled UI updates for the streaming output widget. |

### REPL Support & Callbacks

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `repl_support.py` | Helper functions and callback builders for the REPL. `run_textual_repl()` creates and runs the app. Callback builders wire core events to UI components. |
| `request_bridge.py` | Thread-safe queue bridge for streaming/thinking deltas and UI-thread notice/compaction messages. |
| `shell_runner.py` | `ShellRunner` — async shell command execution for `!cmd` syntax. Handles timeouts, cancellation (SIGINT), and formats output via NeXTSTEP panels. |

### Screens (Modal Dialogs)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `screens/setup.py` | First-time configuration wizard for provider, model, and API key selection. |
| `screens/model_picker.py` | Two-step model selection: `ProviderPickerScreen` → `ModelPickerScreen`. Supports filtering and displays pricing. |
| `screens/session_picker.py` | Session resumption modal with message preview. Lists sessions by ID, model, and last modified date. |
| `screens/theme_picker.py` | Theme selection modal for switching between tunacode, nextstep, and builtin themes. |
| `screens/update_confirm.py` | Confirmation dialog before installing package updates. |

### Widgets (Reusable Components)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `widgets/chat.py` | `ChatContainer` — scrollable chat history with insertion point tracking. `CopyOnSelectStatic` preserves mouse selection for Rich renderables. `SelectableRichVisual` injects offset metadata for selection. |
| `render_safety.py` | Resolves ANSI/default Rich colors to concrete theme-aware colors and precomputes `dim` styling before Textual 4.0.0 filter handling. Shared by chat rendering and welcome-screen startup output. |
| `widgets/editor.py` | `Editor` — enhanced single-line input with Enter-submit, bash-mode (`!` prefix), paste buffer for multiline input, and custom rendering. |
| `widgets/resource_bar.py` | Top status bar displaying token usage percentage, model name, session cost, LSP server status, and compaction activity. |
| `widgets/status_bar.py` | Bottom status bar with 3 zones: git branch/location (left), edited files (mid), last action (right). |
| `widgets/command_autocomplete.py` | Slash-command auto-completion for the editor. |
| `widgets/file_autocomplete.py` | File path auto-completion for the editor. |

### Renderers (Rich Panel System)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `renderers/panels.py` | `RichPanelRenderer` — base renderer for tool panels, error panels, search results, and info panels. `PanelMeta` defines CSS styling and border titles. |
| `renderers/agent_response.py` | Renders finalized agent responses as NeXTSTEP-style panels with markdown content and throughput stats. |
| `renderers/errors.py` | Renders exceptions with severity mapping, suggested fixes, recovery commands, and extracted context fields. |
| `renderers/search.py` | Renders file/code search results with pagination and indexing status. |
| `renderers/tools/` | Tool-specific renderers for bash, discover, read_file, hashline_edit, write_file, web_fetch, and diagnostics helpers. Apply syntax highlighting and truncation. |

### Command System
All slash commands are implemented as `Command` subclasses and registered in `COMMANDS`. `handle_command()` also routes shell commands (`!<cmd>`), legacy `exit`, and slash `/exit`.
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `commands/base.py` | `Command` abstract base class defining the command interface (`name`, `description`, optional `usage`, `execute(app, args)`). |
| `commands/__init__.py` | Slash command registry and router. Maps command name to instance and dispatches `/` commands in `handle_command()`. |
| `commands/help.py` | `/help` command rendering command/description table. |
| `commands/cancel.py` | `/cancel` command for canceling the current request, shell command, or modal action. |
| `commands/clear.py` | `/clear` command for clearing transient agent state while preserving message history for `/resume`. |
| `commands/compact.py` | `/compact` command for manual context compaction and token reclamation. |
| `commands/debug.py` | `/debug` command toggling debug log output. |
| `commands/model.py` | `/model` command for picker-based and direct model selection. |
| `commands/update.py` | `/update` command for checking and installing TunaCode updates. |
| `commands/resume.py` | `/resume` command for listing, loading, and deleting sessions. |
| `commands/skills.py` | `/skills` command for searching the local skill catalog and attaching skills to the session. |
| `commands/theme.py` | `/theme` command for picker-based and direct theme switching by name. |
| `commands/thoughts.py` | `/thoughts` command for toggling the streaming thought panel. |
| `commands/exit.py` | `/exit` command for quitting TunaCode via slash input. |

### Command Contract

- Each command module (excluding `base.py` and `__init__.py`) defines one concrete `Command` subclass.
- `name` and `description` must be set and non-empty; `usage` is optional.
- `execute` must be `async` and accept `(app, args)`.
- Each concrete command must be present in `COMMANDS` with its `name` as the key.

This contract is enforced in `tests/unit/ui/test_command_contracts.py`.
### ESC Key Handling

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `esc/handler.py` | `EscHandler` — centralized ESC key logic. Priority order: cancel request → cancel shell command. |
| `esc/types.py` | Protocol definitions for editor and shell runner injection. |

### Context Panel

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `context_panel.py` | `ContextPanelWidgets` builder — constructs inspector fields for the right-side "Session Inspector" rail (model, tokens, cost, edits, slopgotchi pet). |
| `slopgotchi/__init__.py` | Exports `SlopgotchiHandler`, `SlopgotchiPanelState`. |
| `slopgotchi/panel.py` | Slopgotchi pet widget — ASCII art cycling, click-triggered heart animation, margin bounce. |

### Utilities

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `model_display.py` | Model name formatting for the resource bar (truncates long model IDs). |
| `clipboard.py` | Clipboard copy helpers for selected Textual widgets. Tries OSC 52, `pyperclip`, and platform clipboard commands with verification reads when possible. |
| `request_debug.py` | Low-noise request/input latency tracing used when `/debug` is enabled. |
| `styles.py` | Color constants for UI components (`STYLE_PRIMARY`, `STYLE_WARNING`, etc.). |
| `welcome.py` | Welcome message rendered on fresh REPL start. |
| `logo_assets.py` | ASCII logo assets for the TUI. |

## How

### Application Startup Flow

```
tunacode (CLI)
    |
    v
main.py typer app
    |
    v
_default_command()
    |-- `--help` / `--version` exit before config load
    |-- rejects `--setup` when combined with a subcommand
    |
    v
_run_textual_cli()
    |
    v
_run_textual_app()
    |-- _get_state_manager() lazily constructs StateManager
    |-- catches ConfigurationError and prints a clean startup error
    |-- _apply_base_url_override()  (if --baseurl)
    |-- creates background update check
    |
    v
TextualReplApp(state_manager, show_setup)
    |
    v
on_mount()
    |-- Register themes (tunacode, nextstep, builtin)
    |-- Load saved theme from config
    |-- Initialize session metadata (project_id, working_dir, created_at)
    |
    v
if show_setup:
    push_screen(SetupScreen) → _on_setup_complete → _start_repl
else:
    _start_repl()
```

### Startup/Error Behavior

- `StateManager` is no longer created at module import time.
- CLI parse-only paths such as `tunacode --help` and `tunacode --version` do not require a valid user config file.
- Runtime startup still validates config when the app actually launches, and malformed config is surfaced as a user-visible `ConfigurationError`.
- `_reset_state_manager()` clears the cached manager after each CLI run so repeated startup tests and subprocess runs do not reuse stale state.

### REPL Request Flow

```
User types in Editor → Enter
    |
    v
on_editor_submit_requested()
    |
    v
handle_command() checks for /command or !shell
    |
    +-- /help, /model, /theme, etc. → execute command
    |
    +-- !cmd → ShellRunner.start()
    |
    +-- Agent request → request_queue.put(message)
    |
    v
_request_worker() coroutine
    |
    v
_process_request()
    |
    v
process_request(core.agents.main)
    |-- build_textual_tool_callback()
    |-- streaming_callback (throttled UI updates)
    |-- build_tool_result_callback()
    |-- build_tool_start_callback()
    |
    v
Streaming events:
    |-- message_update → StreamingHandler.callback() → streaming_output widget
    |-- tool_execution_start → status bar "running: tool_name"
    |-- tool_execution_end → ToolResultDisplay → ChatContainer.write()
    |-- turn_end → update iteration count
    |
    v
Finalized:
    |-- _get_latest_response_text()
    |-- render_agent_response() → ChatContainer.write()
    |-- _update_resource_bar()
    |-- await save_session()
```

### ESC Key Handling

```
User presses ESC
    |
    v
action_cancel_request()
    |
    v
EscHandler.handle_escape()
    |
    v
Priority 1: cancel current request task
    |
    v
Priority 2: cancel running shell command
```

**UI Behavior on Cancel:**
- Completed tool panels already rendered to the chat remain visible
- In-flight tool calls and streaming responses are stopped
- A "Cancelled" notification appears
- Loading indicator and streaming output are cleared
- Status bar updates to show the cancelled action

### Rendering Pipeline
```
Agent/tool output → Renderer function
    |
    v
render_*(args, result, duration_ms, max_width)
    |
    v
Returns (content: RichRenderable, PanelMeta)
    |
    v
ChatContainer.write(content, panel_meta=meta)
    |
    v
CopyOnSelectStatic widget
    |-- Applies CSS classes from PanelMeta
    |-- Sets border_title/border_subtitle
    |-- Preserves mouse selection for Rich renderables
```

### Panel Rendering (NeXTSTEP Style)

```
RichPanelRenderer.render_tool()
    |
    v
Determine PanelType (TOOL, ERROR, SEARCH, INFO, SUCCESS, WARNING)
    |
    v
Lookup styles from PANEL_STYLES (border, title, subtitle colors)
    |
    v
Build content parts:
    |-- Arguments table (if any)
    |-- Result (truncated to MAX_PANEL_LINES)
    |-- Footer (duration_ms, line count)
    |
    v
Return (Group(*content), PanelMeta(css_class, border_title, border_subtitle))
```

## Why

The UI layer follows **NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines** (see `.claude/skills/neXTSTEP-ui/`): clear information hierarchy, no hidden state, consistent visual language, and respect for user attention.

**Why ChatContainer with insertion anchors?**
- Tool results may arrive after the agent response has already rendered.
- Insertion anchors ensure late-arriving content appears in the correct logical position.
- Without tracking, tool panels would always appear at the bottom, breaking conversation flow.

**Why ESC handler as separate component?**
- ESC has two distinct responsibilities (cancel request, cancel shell).
- Hardcoding logic in TextualReplApp creates tight coupling and makes testing difficult.
- Dependency injection via `EscHandler.handle_escape()` allows protocol-based testing.

**Why throttled streaming updates?**
- Textual re-rendering is expensive. Updating on every chunk causes UI lag.
- `STREAM_THROTTLE_MS = 100ms` batches updates while maintaining perceived responsiveness.

**Why Rich-selection support?**
- Chat messages and tool panels include Rich renderables, not just plain text widgets.
- `SelectableRichVisual` injects offset metadata that Textual's selection requires but doesn't provide by default.
- `render_safety.normalize_rich_style()` resolves ANSI/default colors and clears `dim` before Textual filters run, which keeps startup welcome rendering and theme preview changes from crashing on unresolved Rich colors.
- `CopyOnSelectStatic.get_selection()` extracts text from rendered strips so selections still work.
- `TextualReplApp` binds `ctrl+y` and `ctrl+shift+c` to `copy_selection_to_clipboard()`, which mirrors the current selection into the system clipboard via OSC 52, `pyperclip`, or platform-native commands.

**Why separate renderers per tool?**
- Generic panels are functional but lack tool-specific formatting.
- `render_bash` shows exit code and working directory context.
- `render_read_file` applies syntax highlighting.
- `render_diagnostics` formats LSP errors with file positions.

**Why slash command system?**
- Extensible command registration via `COMMANDS` dict.
- Each command is an isolated `Command` subclass with clear `name`, `description`, `usage`.
- Easy to add new commands without modifying routing logic.

**Why status bar 3-zone layout?**
- Left: location context (branch, directory) — always relevant.
- Mid: edited files — operational state, shows what's been modified.
- Right: last/running action — immediate feedback on what just happened.
