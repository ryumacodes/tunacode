# Simple ESC Cancellation Test

## Quick Test Instructions

1. **Start TunaCode**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/affan/Projects/untitled folder/tunacode
   ./venv/bin/python -m tunacode.cli.main
   ```

2. **Skip branch creation** (type `n`)

3. **Test with a slower command**:
   - Type one of these commands that take longer to process:
     ```
     explain the entire codebase architecture in detail
     ```
     or
     ```
     write a comprehensive guide for all the files in the src directory
     ```
     or  
     ```
     analyze all python files and explain their relationships
     ```

4. **Press ESC during processing**:
   - Wait until you see:
     ```
     ðŸŽ¯ Running agent with trio-asyncio integration...
     ðŸš€ Starting agent processing with cancellation monitoring...
     ðŸ”§ Attempting simplified trio-asyncio integration...
     ```
   - **Press ESC once or twice**
   - You should see:
     ```
     ðŸ”‘ ESC KEY DETECTED!
     ðŸ›‘ TRIGGERING ABORT CONTROLLER
     âœ… ABORT TRIGGERED - should cancel Trio scope
     ```

5. **What should happen**:
   - The agent processing should stop
   - You should NOT see "âœ… Agent processing completed successfully"
   - Instead, you might see a cancellation message
   - The prompt should return and be responsive

## Why the Test Didn't Work

The `/debug test` command tried to use raw keyboard monitoring which conflicts with prompt_toolkit's input handling. The real ESC handling works through the keybindings in the REPL, not through raw terminal access.

## Alternative Test

If you want to see cancellation working without typing a real command:

```python
# In the REPL, type this to simulate a slow operation:
import time; [time.sleep(0.1) for _ in range(100)]
```

Then press ESC while it's running!

## Debug Output

The ESC detection is working (you saw the messages), but you need a longer-running operation to actually cancel. The `ls` command completed too quickly.
