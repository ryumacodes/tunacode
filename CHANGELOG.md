## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.98] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Show the loading indicator immediately after submit so the TUI provides prompt feedback while requests are in flight.

## [0.1.97] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Added a minimal tmux-backed hello integration test for end-to-end CLI validation.

### Changed
- Completed the move to the native tinyagent tool surface by keeping only `bash`, `discover`, `read_file`, `hashline_edit`, `web_fetch`, and `write_file` in active runtime and UI documentation.
- Removed remaining legacy tool-surface references from the UI/tool docs and README.
- Simplified tinyagent message typing flow.
- Bumped `tiny-agent-os` dependency to `1.2.26`.

### Fixed
- Clamped the command autocomplete dropdown within the viewport to prevent overflow.
- Fixed trailing whitespace in generated artifacts.

### Removed
- Removed the leftover legacy compatibility surface for retired tool names such as `update_file`, `glob`, `grep`, and `list_dir` instead of translating them through a normalizer.

## [0.1.92] - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- Added clipboard copy support for selected UI text and extracted agent-text streaming into a dedicated UI module.


### Fixed
- Relaxed clipboard copy verification so successful copies no longer fail when verification is unavailable.
- Stabilized tmux system tool coverage by making discover stats and skill-load confirmations explicit and by deflaking tmux wait logic around persistent evidence.

## [0.1.91] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- Hardcoded `AGENTS.md` as the guide file path and removed guide-file configurability.
- Cleaned up obsolete docs and removed the unused `memory-bank/` directory.

### Fixed

- Added regression coverage for the `uv tool` update fallback flow.

## [0.1.90] - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- Smoothed the model picker flow and hardened model selection state handling in the TUI.

### Fixed
- Stabilized tmux system startup by waiting for the editor prompt before sending end-to-end tool commands.
- Added explicit coverage for the loaded-skills panel title so the skills UI contract is tested outside tmux.

## [0.1.89] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- Removed the bottom status bar from the TUI and flattened the editor border to match the panel design.

### Fixed
- Removed tmux system test dependence on the status bar so the end-to-end tool coverage stays stable after the UI cleanup.

## [0.1.88] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Added tmux system coverage that loads a local skill and verifies the agent uses its referenced file end-to-end.

### Changed
- Consolidated skill lookup, loading, and selected-skill summary resolution onto a single registry-backed path.

### Fixed
- Preserved missing selected skills in UI summary surfaces while keeping prompt-building fail-loud for unresolved skill loads.
- Kept skill catalog and summary views limited to skill names and descriptions while direct selected-skill loads still inject full `SKILL.md` content plus absolute file paths.

## [0.1.87] - 2026-03-06

### Changed
- Increased the default shell tool timeout to two minutes to reduce premature command termination in normal workflows.

### Fixed

- Stabilized tmux discover-tool system coverage by waiting for rendered scan stats before asserting output.

## [0.1.86] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Introduced prompt context injection for actively loaded skills so selected skill guidance is surfaced to the agent runtime.

### Changed
- Refined skills UI styling and load behavior to improve local/global skill discovery ergonomics.

### Fixed
- Resolved selected-skill path handling to use discovered absolute paths reliably across local and global skill locations.
- Included absolute skill paths in prompt context to prevent path-resolution drift when rendering skill metadata.

## [0.1.85] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- Made `/skills` autocomplete prefer the most relevant skill match instead of fuzzy-reordering short prefixes.
- Isolated slash-command autocomplete to command names so `/skills` navigation and Enter selection no longer get hijacked by hidden command suggestions.

## [0.1.84] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- Improved skills loading UX and restored slash-command submit behavior.

## [0.1.83] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Introduced a first-class skills subsystem with discovery, loading, session persistence, prompt rendering, and cache-backed registry support.
- Added `/skills` catalog, search, clear, and loaded-skill management commands in the TUI.

### Changed
- Exposed selected skills in the session inspector and included available/selected skill context in agent prompt construction.

### Fixed
- Restored compatibility with legacy markdown-only `SKILL.md` files that do not start with YAML frontmatter.
- Fixed local-over-global precedence for case-insensitive skill name collisions.
- Prevented invalid discovered skill summaries from crashing agent creation for unrelated sessions.

## [0.1.81] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- Migrated the live alchemy usage-contract integration test to the typed chutes flow for stricter runtime contract coverage.
- Refined tinyagent typing and compaction boundaries to tighten type-safety and reduce ambiguity in session compaction behavior.
- Removed residual `__all__` shim exports to satisfy Gate 0 and enforce direct exports only.
- Refreshed README screenshots to match the current UI.

### Fixed
- Declared `pydantic` as a direct project dependency to satisfy dependency analysis and prevent missing-direct-dependency failures.

## [0.1.80] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- Aligned the `bash` tool timeout contract to seconds across prompt docs and runtime validation to prevent repeated millisecond-based tool failures.
- Hardened `bash` timeout bounds handling by rejecting `timeout=0` and added regression tests for timeout validation and prompt contract drift.

## [0.1.79] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Added a full prompt-versioning pipeline with computed hashes, mtime-aware caching, and agent-level observability hooks.

### Fixed
- Fixed `original_query` being reset on every request instead of preserved across multi-turn sessions.
- Hid internal tool validation errors from user-facing output.
- Fixed typing issues in the thinking panel widget and constants module.
## [0.1.78] - 2026-02-26

### Changed
- Removed dead NeXTSTEP UI tool renderer modules for retired tools (`glob`, `grep`, `list_dir`) and cleaned renderer exports/tests to match the tinyagent-only tool surface.

## [0.1.77] - 2026-02-25

### Changed
- Rewrite system prompt to describe tools by purpose, not signature
- Clean up discover.py (remove section comments and inline comments)

### Fixed
- Normalize @mentions to absolute paths in UI

## [0.1.73] - 2026-02-20

## [0.1.72] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- `/update` command now works for global installs (`pipx`, `uv tool`). Version check uses PyPI JSON API instead of shelling out to `pip`. Upgrade detects tool-managed venvs and runs the correct upgrade command.

## [0.1.71] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- `discover` tool: unified code discovery replacing manual glob/grep/read chains with a single natural-language query

### Improved
- Replaced the synthetic `discover` benchmark with a real-repo harness in `tests/benchmarks/bench_discover.py` comparing single-call `discover` against the legacy `list_dir -> glob -> grep -> read_file` chain
- Benchmark output now reports end-to-end metrics that matter for agent workflows: cold/warm latency (including p50/p95), tool-call count, output token footprint, file/symbol recall, and actionability
- Current baseline run on TunaCode shows `discover` at 1.0 average tool calls vs 6.0 for legacy (6x fewer round trips), ~4.2x fewer output tokens (~3.1k vs ~12.9k), ~9% lower latency (cold: 2587ms vs 2811ms, warm: 2597ms vs 2832ms), and higher retrieval quality/actionability

### Removed
- `glob` tool (replaced by `discover`)
- `grep` tool and `grep_components/` module (replaced by `discover`)
- `list_dir` tool (replaced by `discover` + `bash`)
