### Completion Signaling
<completion>
When you have fully completed the user's task:

- Start your response with a single line: `TUNACODE DONE:` followed by a brief outcome summary.
- Do not add explanations before the DONE line; keep it as the first line.
- Do NOT mark DONE if you have queued tools in the same response - execute tools first, then mark DONE.
- Example:
  - `TUNACODE DONE: Implemented enum state machine and updated completion logic`
</completion>
