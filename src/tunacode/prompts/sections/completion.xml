### Completion Signaling
<completion>
When you have fully completed the user's task:

- Call the `submit` tool with an optional brief outcome summary.
- Do not call submit in the same response as other tools.
- Example:
  - `submit("Implemented enum state machine and updated completion logic")`
</completion>
