When to use:
- Complex multi-step tasks (3+ steps)

When NOT to use:
- Single, straightforward tasks
- Trivial tasks under 3 steps
- Purely conversational or informational requests

Schema:
- content: Task description in imperative form (e.g., "Fix the bug")

- activeForm: Present continuous form (e.g., "Fixing the bug")

Rules:
- Only ONE task should be in_progress at a time

- Never mark incomplete work as completed
