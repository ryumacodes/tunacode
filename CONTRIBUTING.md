# Contributing to tunacode

Thanks for your interest in contributing to tunacode! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## **AI-Assisted Contributions**

**AI-generated PRs are welcome, but keep them small and clean.** Large, unstacked PRs are hard to review; small diffs help CodeRabbit run cleanly and let maintainers review quickly.

Using AI tools to help write code or documentation is welcome. However:

- **Follow all project standards** - AI output must meet the same quality bar as human-written code
- **Review and refine** - Don't submit raw AI output without careful review
- **No low-effort submissions** - PRs that are clearly unreviewed AI-generated content will be closed

The maintainers can tell the difference. Put in the effort.

## Getting Help

- **Questions & Ideas**: Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tunacode/discussions)
- **Bug Reports**: Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tunacode/issues)
- **Discord**: [Discord](https://discord.gg/TN7Fpynv6H)

## Development Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (tested on 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (not pip)

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tunacode.git
cd tunacode

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

## Code Standards

### Formatting & Linting

- **Ruff** handles both linting and formatting (line length: 100)
- Run `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .` before committing

### Type Hints

- Explicit type hints are required
- `cast()` and `assert` are acceptable
- `# type: ignore` only with strong justification

### File Length

- Maximum **600 lines** per Python file (enforced in CI)
- PRs will fail if any file exceeds this limit

### Code Style

- **No magic numbers** - use symbolic constants
- **Flatten conditionals** - return early, make pre-conditions explicit
- **Fail fast, fail loud** - no silent fallbacks or error swallowing
- **No dead code** - delete unused code entirely (never comment out or guard)
- **Keep it simple** - avoid over-engineering and unnecessary abstractions

### Error Handling

- Minimize branching - every `if`/`try` must be justified
- Never silently catch and ignore exceptions
- Fail explicitly with clear error messages

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch
2. Make **small, focused changes** - one logical change per commit
3. **Commit frequently** with clear messages
4. Run checks locally before pushing:
   ```bash
   uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .   # Lint and format
   uv run mypy src/                               # Type checking
   uv run pytest                                  # Run tests
   ```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest                    # Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/             # Run specific directory
uv run pytest --cov=src/tunacode # Run with coverage
```

### Test Expectations

- All existing tests must pass
- New features should include tests
- Golden/characterization tests are preferred for complex behavior

## Pull Request Process

### Before Opening a PR

**Rebase onto master before opening your PR.** This project changes frequently (week to week), and stale branches cause merge conflicts and CI failures. Run:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
```

If your PR is open and master moves ahead, that's fine - but the initial PR must be rebased.

**All pre-commit hooks must pass.** Run `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` before opening your PR. If hooks fail, fix the issues locally. You can open a draft PR anytime, but **when you mark it ready for review, all checks must pass or the PR will be closed.**

If the dev environment setup (`uv sync --extra dev && uv run pre-commit install`) is not working for you, please open an issue or PR to fix it - don't submit PRs that skip hooks.

### PR Requirements

1. **Fill out the PR template** completely
2. **Rebase onto master** (see above)
3. Ensure all checks pass:
   - Ruff lint and format checks
   - File length validation (600 lines max)
   - pydantic-usage-guard (no new pydantic-ai imports)
4. Self-review your changes
5. Update documentation if needed
6. **Address CodeRabbit feedback** - We use [CodeRabbit AI](https://coderabbit.ai) for automated code review. Please fix any issues it identifies.

### Pydantic-AI Containment

**Do not add new pydantic-ai imports.** The project has a CI guard (`pydantic-usage-guard`) that fails if pydantic-ai usage increases. If you need pydantic-ai types, wrap them through the adapter layer in `src/tunacode/utils/messaging/` instead of importing directly in core modules.

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project style (type hints, no magic numbers, etc.)
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] No file exceeds 600 lines
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] CodeRabbit feedback addressed
