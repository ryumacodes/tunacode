Thinking Box Fix Summary:
========================

Changes made:
1. Added `transient=True` to Rich Live display
   - This clears the display area when interrupted
   
2. Changed ESC monitor from raw mode to cbreak mode
   - Less intrusive terminal mode that doesn't conflict with Rich
   
3. Added small delay before ESC monitoring
   - Allows Rich to properly set up its display
   
4. Improved error handling in stop() method
   - Ensures cleanup even if errors occur

Test Instructions:
1. Run: python -m tunacode
2. Type: ls
3. When you see the thinking box, press ESC
4. The thinking box should disappear cleanly
5. You should see "Request cancelled" message
6. The prompt should return without duplicate thinking boxes

Expected behavior:
- Only one thinking box appears at a time
- ESC cleanly cancels and removes the thinking box
- No duplicate or stacked thinking boxes
- No partial panel borders left on screen
