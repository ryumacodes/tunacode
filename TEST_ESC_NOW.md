# Test ESC Cancellation Now

The fix has been applied! Here's what should happen now:

## Run TunaCode
```bash
cd /Users/affan/Projects/untitled folder/tunacode
./venv/bin/python -m tunacode.cli.main
```

## Test ESC Cancellation

1. **Type any command** like `ls`
2. **Wait for the processing messages**:
   ```
   ðŸŽ¯ Running agent with trio-asyncio integration...
   ðŸš€ Starting agent processing with cancellation monitoring...
   ðŸ”§ Attempting simplified trio-asyncio integration...
   ```
3. **Press ESC once or twice**
4. **You should see**:
   ```
   ðŸ”‘ ESC KEY DETECTED!
   ðŸ›‘ TRIGGERING ABORT CONTROLLER
   âœ… ABORT TRIGGERED - should cancel Trio scope
   ðŸ›‘ ABORT DETECTED - cancelling agent processing
   ðŸ›‘ AGENT PROCESSING CANCELLED BY ESC!
   âœ… Request cancelled
   ```

## What Changed

Added an abort checker that runs in parallel with the agent processing:
- Monitors abort controller every 100ms
- When ESC is pressed â†’ abort controller triggers â†’ scope is cancelled â†’ trio.Cancelled exception
- The exception is caught and shows "Request cancelled"

## Expected Behavior

- âœ… ESC detection works
- âœ… Abort controller triggers  
- âœ… Agent processing stops mid-execution
- âœ… REPL remains responsive
- âœ… No "Agent processing completed successfully" message
