"""
Characterization tests for tool UI behavior.

These tests capture the CURRENT behavior of tool UI interactions, including
how read-only tools skip confirmation dialogs and info messages.

IMPORTANT: These are golden-master tests - they document how the system
actually behaves, not how it should ideally behave. Any changes to these
tests indicate a change in system behavior that should be carefully reviewed.

Key behaviors captured:
- Read-only tools (read_file, grep, list_dir, glob) skip the "Tool()" info message
- All tools still call run_in_terminal, but read-only tools' confirm_func returns False immediately
- Yolo mode skips all info messages and confirmations
- Tool ignore list behaves similarly to yolo mode for specific tools
- Unknown/custom tools are treated as requiring confirmation

# Test Coverage Summary:
# ======================
# This file provides comprehensive characterization tests for tool UI behavior.
# It captures the exact behavior of the system as of the time of writing.
#
# Key test scenarios covered:
# 1. Read-only tools (no UI messages, quick execution)
# 2. Write/execute tools (full confirmation flow)
# 3. Yolo mode (skip all confirmations)
# 4. Tool ignore list (selective confirmation skipping)
# 5. Unknown/custom tools (default to safe behavior)
# 6. Direct _tool_confirm function behavior
# 7. MCP tool logging (external tool transparency)
# 8. User abort handling (clean error propagation)
# 9. Spinner lifecycle (UI responsiveness)
#
# These tests use mocking extensively to isolate UI behavior from actual tool
# execution, making them fast and reliable.

        The spinner is a visual indicator that shows the AI is "thinking" or processing.
        During tool confirmations, the spinner must be stopped so users can interact
        with the confirmation dialog, then restarted after the interaction.
        
        This test verifies the spinner lifecycle:
        1. Spinner.stop() is called BEFORE any user interaction
        2. User interaction happens (confirmation dialog)
        3. Spinner.start() is called AFTER interaction completes
        
        This ensures a smooth UI experience where the spinner doesn't interfere
        with user input and resumes to show ongoing processing.
