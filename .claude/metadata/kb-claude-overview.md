kb-claude frames the .claude folder as a living ontology rather than loose notes. Each entry is typed, traceable, and meant to live in version control.
- Prioritize text-native storage: YAML front matter plus Markdown body.
- Enforce type alignment with subfolders to keep search predictable.
- Treat entries as part changelog, part design journal, and part research log.
- Use tags and ontological relations aggressively to stitch the shared mental model.
