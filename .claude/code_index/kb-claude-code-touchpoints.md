File references that matter for the kb-claude knowledge base inside this repository.
- `.claude/`: typed knowledge store seeded with ontological entries; CLI will operate here when introduced.
- `AGENTS.md`: repository automation rules for agents working in tunacode.
- `CLAUDE.md`: project design philosophy plus expectations for .claude maintenance.
- `README.md`: high-level description of tunacode as a TUI code agent; informs how kb-claude documentation should align with the product narrative.
No kb-claude CLI code lives here yet; this KB tracks the expected workflow until integration work lands.
